# Code Editors

## VS Code

Visual Studio Code \(VS Code\) is a cross-platform editor from Microsoft. It has a plethora of features, built-in tools, and plugins to help your write and debug your Empirica code. And it is particularly easy to install, launch, and use.

To get started, head over to [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), download the installer, and follow the instructions. That's it's you're ready to go.

#### On Windows with WSL

You first need to install it on your normal Windows machine as instructed above. Then you need to get this extension install on your VS Code: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl)

Once this is done, you can easily launch VS Code from the command line in your WSL with:

```text
code <directory>
```

Or if you want to open the directory you are currently in with VS Code you can use:

```text
code .
```

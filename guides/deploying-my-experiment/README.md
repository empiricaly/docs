# Deploying your experiment

This tutorial describes how to connect to [`MongoDB Atlas`](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for your database service and [`Meteor Galaxy`](https://www.meteor.com/cloud)\(a service directly provided by Meteor\) for your app hosting service.  Other services are also available, and we find these particularly easy with Empirica.

_To understand the role of database and hosting, see documentation on the_ [_general structure of an Empirica experiment_](../../overview/structure.md)_._

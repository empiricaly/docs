### **Windows 10 Setup**

Empirica is build on industry-standard open-source web technologies which run best in Unix-like operating systems such as Linux and MacOS.   ****

In order to run Empirica reliably in Windows, you will need to enable developer settings within advanced Windows settings and download/install the new version of Windows Subsystem for Linux \(WLS2\).

If you are a Windows user and get stuck at any point in the development process, please contact joshua.becker@ucl.ac.uk or join the Slack channel for community-based technical support on a wide range of topics.

Proceed to the next section for instructions on installing and using Empirica in Windows.

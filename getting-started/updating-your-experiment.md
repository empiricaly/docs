# Updating your experiment

## Check your Empirica Core version

If you are unsure as to which version of Empirica you have, you can run this line in your app to show you all the meteor packages in the app, including Empirica Core:

```bash
meteor list
```

## Updating the Empirica Core

As new versions of Empirica become available, you might want to update the version you are using in your app. To do so, simply run:

```bash
meteor update empirica:core
```

_Note: you might not want to update your empirica:core in the middle of a project unless it solves an important problem._
